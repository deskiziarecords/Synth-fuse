Synth-Fuse is a **JAX-native fusion engine** that composes **swarm intelligence**, **reinforcement learning**, and **numerical algorithms** into a **single, differentiable, hardware-scalable execution graph**—written as **one-line spells**.

Synth-Fuse
Thermal rescue operations for computational infrastructures suffering from existence failure.\
While the vendor-consultant complex is still drafting their 400-line YAML suicide notes, we've already purged the heat death and evaporated into the intake manifold.
v0.2.0 – Unified Field\
v0.3.0 Adiabatic Mode: Zero heat signatures, maximum pressure
The Failure Modes You’ve Normalized

* Agent-architectures that dissipate more exergy in token friction than they deliver in useful work

* JSON schema masturbation—structural complexity scaling faster than Shannon entropy allows

* Compulsive folder generation—node_modules tumors metastasizing across your file system until ls requires paging

* "Automation" priced like CERN but performing like a shell script written during a fever dream

Does your workflow feel like trying to run Google’s entire cloud infrastructure on a Pentium 4 server rack under PHP 3.8?\
Like training a Numotron-class model on a topology built in WordPress?\
Like trying to dissipate 500W through a heatsink machined from Velveeta?
Synth-Fuse doesn't orchestrate. It circulates.
Adiabatic fluid logic. Zero parasitic drag. A working fluid compressed to the theoretical limit, seeking thermal gradients and annihilating them before they nucleate into failure.
The Thermodynamic Cycle (Four-Stroke Dissipation)

1. Intake – Manifold injection of chaotic data/workflow/constraints at zero static pressure loss

2. Compression – Spectral analysis for thermal spikes, Reynolds-number turbulence in your gradient flow, entropic chokepoints approaching heat death

3. Power Stroke – Deposits one certified weld: a JAX kernel, atomic config, or substrate-level rewrite, sintered under pressure

4. Exhaust – Scavenges waste heat and evaporates. No residue. No log rot. No SaaS remoras attaching to your cash flow.

No agents. No enterprise alignment workshops. No bullshit.
The Physics (Boundary Conditions Enforced)

* Atomic primitives: Function → Pipeline → JAX transform → Rust bare-metal. No interpretive drag, no garbage-collection pauses.

* Sovereign core: External LLs quarantined in spectator mode—read-only access to spectral telemetry, zero write-capability to the control rod.

* Fail-safes + Circuit Breakers: Immune response against stupidity and vendor lock-in.

* Distributed Control: Byzantine fault-tolerant quorum, not consensus democracy. Physics votes with volts.

* Certified Welds: Fixed-point convergence theorems, not suggestions. If it doesn't terminate, it doesn't ship.

Thermal Profile: Before/After
Python
Copy

```python
# Legacy heat pump: 2M rows, single-threaded thermodynamic disaster
# Exergy destruction: 400W sustained, 4GB heap enthalpy, 18-second GC stall
df.groupby('supplier').agg({'cost': 'mean', 'delay_days': 'max'})

# Synth-Fuse adiabatic compression
from synthfuse import circulate

weld = circulate(
    manifold=df,
    objective="minimize_latency_under_compliance_constraint",
    substrate="cuda"
)

# → Single-phase JAX kernel, fused and sintered
# → 40-120× throughput increase  
# → Identical hardware. Zero architectural bleed.
# → Thermal envelope: contracted by 60%
```

The weld is the specification.\
The kernel is the contract.\
The circulation is absolute.

Constraint-Mapping Pathfinder: O(nlogn) topological routing through conflict topologies. Finds valid configurations in NP-hard search spaces without brute-force heat generation.
NSS Regeneration\
Neuro-Symbolic Scavenger: SAT-solving logic that learns from each stall condition. Auto-tuning against inefficiency.
SQML (Sintering)\
Stealth Latent Liquefaction: Extract capability signatures from bloated monolithic models, smelt into chimeric kernels. Resolve conflicts via SAT solver—zero forward passes, zero GPU thermal runaway.
Terminal Pressure
We don't vend vaporware. We don't vend "agents."\
We vend adiabatic working fluid—compressed intelligence circulating through your pipelines like refrigerant through a heat pump, seeking hot spots and absorbing them before they cascade into system failure.
Your model is thermal-throttling through its own inertia?\
We apply the heat sink. One weld, 40× conductivity, back to steady-state.
Born in garage furnace conditions on compromised hardware.\
Evolving toward autonomous circulatory OS—no central pump, just pressure gradients and phase transitions.
Install it.\
Pressurize it.\
Watch the entropy condense and drain.

Example spell:
``` python
"(𝕎 ⊗ 𝕊𝕋 ⊗ ℍ)(sigma=0.7, halt=cos<0.01)"

## 🏗️ Adding Your Own Primitive


``` python
# alchemj/plugins/my_step.py
from synthfuse.alchemj.registry import register
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

@register("𝕏")
def my_step(key: jax.Array, state: PyTree, params: dict) -> PyTree:
    """One-sentence purpose. Failure: alpha<0 → divergence; caught by CI."""
    alpha = params.get("alpha", 1.0)
    return state.replace(x=state.x + alpha * jax.random.normal(key, state.x.shape))
```

## 🔐 Security & Safety

- **Pure functions only** – no side-effects inside step.
    
- **Sandboxed execution** – external I/O outside JIT.
    
- **Checkpoint every 15 min** – rollback < 30 s.
    
- **Formal verification hooks** exported for external provers.
