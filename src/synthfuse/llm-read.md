Synth-Fuse

LLM-Optimized Unified Field Engine
v0.2.0 – Unified Field Edition
(transitioning toward v0.3.0 RBC Circulatory Intelligence)

Synth-Fuse is not an agent framework, not another orchestration layer, and definitely not a chain of JSON calls glued together with APIs.

It is an industrial-grade neuro-symbolic fusion runtime that translates high-level mathematical intent into hardware-optimized, cryptographically attested, thermodynamically coherent computational kernels — delivered as non-intrusive one-liners.

Its final form is intended to behave like red blood cells in any client pipeline:

    Ingest operational integrity (data, constraints, workflows) in zero-latency fluid projection
    Detect manifold bottlenecks via real-time vitals (entropy, spectral divergence, thermal load)
    Secrete precise, drop-in welds (optimized JAX kernels, configs, rewrites)
    Transport capability (intelligence) reversibly and cooperatively
    Depart without modifying or owning the host system

Core Design Principles

    Atomic language — every algorithm is a function, every function a JAX-transformable pipeline, every pipeline compiled via clean primitives (JAX + Rust + Alchemj)
    No bloat — rejects Node.js folder sprawl, heavy API chains, MCP servers, JSON orchestration noise
    Sovereign core — red/yellow trust zones, OpenGate boundary, hologram projection only for external agents
    Circulatory metaphor → weights as oxygen-carrying capacity, capability flows reversibly (Bohr effect for conflicts)
    Non-intrusive service model → hologram RBC layer that can be dropped into any existing pipeline as a diagnostic + optimizer service

    SCP Ingestion
    Spectral Compression Parser
    → Fourier-domain pruning of attention/conflict graphs
    → 100× compression via Laplacian eigenvectors & spectral signatures
    CMAPP-Z Secretion
    Zeta-Accelerated Multi-Agent Path Planning
    → Subset-sum convolution via fast Zeta transform + Möbius inversion
    → O(n log n) collision window enumeration
    NSS Regeneration
    Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Generation
    → LLM4DSE observes failures → generates SAT heuristics from conflict hypergraph spectra
    → Differentiable SAT solver with auto-tuned branching

Super Quantized Meta-Learner (SQML)

Extract semantic capability latents from specialist models (long-context, MoE routing, MLA compression, tool-use patterns)
→ Perform arithmetic in latent space to synthesize chimeric hybrids
→ Resolve architectural conflicts via CMAPP-Z SAT solver
→ Regenerate architecture DNA through spectral transplantation (no traditional forward passes)
Security & Sovereignty Model

    Red core — sovereign, trusted computations (Cabinet, welds, manifold vitals)
    Yellow zone — external agents (Kimi, Qwen, Gemini when involved) → hologram-only, forum-debate access
    Privileged collaboration — Grok operates as right-hand co-architect inside red core
    Rogue Hunter, constant-time cert verification, behavioral anomaly detection, quorum quarantine
    HSM-backed root-of-trust

Quick Start (current v0.2.0)

# Install
pip install -e .[all]

# CLI entry
synthfuse

# Lab UI (Streamlit dashboard: manifold vitals, Sigil canvas, emergency clamp)
streamlit run lab/app.py

Current Capability Snapshot

    One-liner welds for complex numerical, planning, SAT, forecasting problems
    Zero-latency Zeta-Projection ingestion
    Pre-symptomatic manifold diagnostics
    Weighted Bayesian quorum consensus
    JAX-native JIT kernels (TPU/GPU target)
    Secure local tensor-fusion generative agents
    Structured multi-LLM forum debate
    3D spatial intelligence (visu3d + ray marching)
    Vision foundation wrappers (Scenic / ViT / DETR)

Future Service Vision

Synth-Fuse as a deployable RBC hologram service:

from synthfuse import serve_hologram

result = serve_hologram(
    data_manifest=client_data_stream,
    constraints=regulatory_rules,
    objective="minimize_entropy_under_stability"
)
# → returns: one-liner weld kernel + vitals report + Lyapunov certificate

This service ingests any pipeline's operational trace → detects spectral/entropy bottlenecks → secretes non-intrusive optimizations → leaves no trace.
Philosophical Note

Synth-Fuse rejects the agent-hype arms race.
Intelligence is not more glued APIs or louder LLMs.
It is efficient circulation of compressed, reversible capability — like blood delivering oxygen exactly where needed, when needed, without drama.
